# Module 1: Basic Calculator Assignment

## Objective:
In this module, you'll be creating a simple calculator using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Assignment Details:
You are required to build a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, feel free to be as creative as you like with the design and functionality! While the core functionality must include the basic operations, the look and feel of your calculator is entirely up to you.

### Tasks:
1. **HTML**:
   - Structure the layout of the calculator with HTML.
   - Include buttons for numbers `0-9`, the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and the `=` button.
   - Add a display area to show the current input or result.

2. **CSS**:
   - Style the calculator to make it visually appealing.
   - Responsive Design: Make sure your calculator works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices. The layout should adapt and remain usable whether viewed on a phone, tablet, or desktop screen. Use media queries to adjust the button sizes, layout, and display area for smaller screens.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Implement the functionality of the calculator using JavaScript.
   - Implement the logic to evaluate the expression when the `=` button is clicked.
